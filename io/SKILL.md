## Google Workspace (via gsa CLI)

The `gsa` command handles Google Sheets, Slides, and Drive. Auth uses existing OAuth credentials at `~/.google_workspace_mcp/credentials/oblinger@gmail.com.json`.

```bash
gsa sheets read <id> [range]       # Read cells as JSON
gsa sheets write <id> <range> <json>  # Write cells
gsa sheets append <id> <range> <json> # Append rows
gsa sheets info <id>               # Sheet metadata
gsa slides read <id>               # Extract all text
gsa slides info <id>               # Presentation metadata
gsa search sheets [query]          # Find spreadsheets
gsa search slides [query]          # Find presentations
```
